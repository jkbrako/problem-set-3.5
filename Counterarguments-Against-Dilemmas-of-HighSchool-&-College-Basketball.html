<h1>Counterarguments Against Troubles</h1>
<p>All of the points stated for <a href="C:\Users\jbrako\Desktop\APCSP\problem-set-3\Highschool-Basketball-Troubles.html">High School Ball</a> and <a href="C:\Users\jbrako\Desktop\APCSP\problem-set-3\College-Basketball-Troubles.html">College Ball</a> are debatable, as with most blogs. These are the most common arguments stated for both sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Highschool athletes have higher intellect than the average student."</li>
<li>"Not all college basketball players want to go to the NBA Draft."</li>
</ol>
<p>I will give my input in order to rationalize anyone's thinking who may be thinking this way.</p>

<h2>"Highschool athletes have higher intellect than the average student."</h2>
<p>This statement is true. But the thing is, that's for the whole sport range along with other activities. This pag is exclusively talking about basketball athletes who <strong>only</strong> play basketball. The extremes are on both side of the school sport spectrum. In a middle-class to wealthy school environmnt make you mor likely to b an excelling scholar at your school. In a low-class school environment, you are more likely to be a "boundary-line" scholar. A boundary lin scholar is a student whose grades barely pass for sport eligibility. I am considering a specific section of sports; <strong>not the whol spectrum.</strong></p>

<h2>"Not all college basketball players want to go to the NBA Draft."</h2>
<p>
  This is the equivalnt to saying not all software developers want to work for Microsoft. Even if they do not/cannot work for Microsoft, they know its a pretty good place to work for a developer. The same thing is true for basketball except is getting into the NBA is <b>extremely unlikely</b>. The chance of even staying in the NBA for longer for 5 years is even lower. Therefore, most  college atletes realize the NBA is not for them. As a result college athletes would be smart to not pursue th NBA as their career but instead something else that interests them or something related to basketball as a basktball coach.
