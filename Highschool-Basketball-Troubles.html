<h1>High School Basketball Troubles</h1>
<center><img src="Images/stress.jpg"></center>
<p>You're looking into choosing an extracurricular activity that you'll enjoy and that will help your future. You realize that the only one is appealing to you is the thing that you love to do: <strong>play basketball</strong>.
Along with other extracurriculars this is a good choice. However when left alone as your only extracurricular activity the effects can be disastourous. <b>First</b>  off, you are limiting yourself to one field as you may be wonderous in others. <b>Second</b>, you may be making school sports priority over actual school. <b>Lastly</b>, you might keep yourself in that sport even if you do not like the treatment you are getting from it. Let's start with expanding your view on what may be beneficial to you as an activity. </p>

<h2>
  #1: Do not limit yourself to one field
</h2>
 <p> Especially if you are a freshman in highschool, use this time to learn what you are good at and what you are not good at.
          It is good to start with something you like to do
  <i>(such as basketball) </i>
  and gradually join things you would not initially think you would be good at. A lot of things can surprise you, especially things you have not taken seriously like you do with basketball. For activities other than basketball go to

<h2>#2: Do not make school sports priority over actual school </h2>
<p>Playing school sports is fun and all but if it's interfering in how well you are doing school. You are going to have to make an ultimatum:
  <strong>Adjust your time-managment to school or take a break from the sport overall.</strong>
  This does not mean you have to leave basketball entirely, nevertheless, there are more things in life other than basketball. Meditate, on this decision as this may be a very important decision for your future.

    #3: Do not keep yourself in the sport if you are not being respected in it.
  </h2>
  <p> You may have a coach that is being aggressive to you and your teammates during a basketball season. In moderation, this is a good thing; it shows
    that you coach cares about your success in the sport. However, excessive treatment can be detrimental to the human mind. It can affect your
    way of thinking and your physical actions; most times for the worst. If this is causing you to feel more stressed than you can handle with schoolwork
    and family activities, its okay to leave from that situation. Doing so does not necessarily make you weak; it just means you should partake in
    one of your favorite hobbies in a different way.</p>
