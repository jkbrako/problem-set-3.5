      <p class="home"> Basketball is one of my favorite sports. I have played in
      organized baketball leagues such as a recreational league. I have considered playing
      even a college scholarship further down the road. However, the cons of playing
      for my home district as it seems it could benefit me on a college resume or
      school basketball at the high level far outweighs the pros. This article will illustrate
      the troubles of high school basketball up to playing college basketball and the counterarguments to them.

      <h2> Overview </h2>
      <p class="home"> Many people decide that they will go into a school sport for an
        addition of a college resume, recognition and/or just for fun; and in
         moderation this is fine but what about how this causes you to sacrifice
         other things in order to commit to basketball. In most cases, there is
         the process of elimination in order to achieve these tasks. If you do
         not have many commitments other than school, than I can understand why
         you would join. However, understand that you are dedicating part of your
         life to something that may not be your daily profession in the future.
         If you do plan to commit your life to basketball, see the section, </p>
