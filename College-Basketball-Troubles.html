      <h1>NCAA</h1>
      <p>If you are playing college basketball you are most likely very talented
        to and considering playing professionally. Therefore, you are now under the
      National College Athletic Association (NCAA). The NCAA oversee college athletes
      by giving them college "benefits" such as scholarships and tuition. Most likely
    you were able to get into college through a scholarship as physical recognition
  of your basketball skills. But if you're thinking of playing professionally, this
is not the end of the road for you. You're now considering playing for the National
Basketball Association (NBA). To do so, you have to commit to the NBA draft. </p>

      <h2>NBA Draft</h2>
    <p> Your committment  to the NBA Draft is a very risky decision. Doing so, you are gambling
      your livelihood to 60 NBA picks (2 Rounds, 30 picks). Also the sad thing is once
      you commit yourself to the NBA Draft is that the NCAA will not take you back. So
      if you do not get into one of the 60 slots you have three main options: The G-League,
      playing international, or commit to a profession that does not involve a college
      education. If you are interested in making basketball apart of your career
      (other than playing) consider being a <a href="https://ncaamarket.ncaa.org/jobs/category/coaching-basketball"> basketball coach</a>. </p>
